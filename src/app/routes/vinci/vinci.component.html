	<h1>VINCI</h1>
	<p>This was a startup that I had been part of throughout undergrad. I worked as the frontend, backend, and mobile developer for the startup. Unfortunately we never launched our product, but what I learned about web and mobile development has been integral in my professional career and personal interests.</p>

	<h2>Inspiration</h2>
	<div class="body">
		<img src="../../../assets/vinciStartUp.png" />
		<p>This project began as an idea to help people connect with each other and in doing so helping them achieve their fitness goals. The idea of this application would have targeted people who were new to an area and wanted to find people to play pickup games with or to find gym partners. We decided that the best way to do this would be to allow users to put their events on a map. The idea was that someone could plan a game of pickup soccer for example and use our platform to market it to anyone who may be interested. The original scope was simple, but we quickly let feature development get ahead of us and we ended up with a lot of extras that weren’t necessary to achieve the initial goal.</p>

	<h2>Research</h2>
	<div class="body">
		<img src="../../../assets/vinciHome.png" />
		<p>As with any project, the first place to start was research. This was my first exposure to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so I started my journey on Codecademy. I completed their courses to get a basic understanding of the languages. Once I had completed these courses, I built a simple landing page where users could gather information about what we were doing. The next step was to create a minimum viable product (MVP). For this I used some simple PHP scripts to interface with a MySQL database. The MVP was only capable of a user posting events to a Google map. This version did not entail any user state or privacy features.<br><br>After the MVP, I started to build a full scale application. I researched some backend frameworks and decided to use Node.JS since I already knew JavaScript and wouldn’t have to bother learning more PHP. I stuck with the same MySQL database that I had been using for the MVP. The frontend migrated to using embedded JavaScript (ejs) files which are similar to HTML but that you can inject JavaScript to alter the DOM when the page is initially parsed.</p>

	<h2>User State</h2>
	<div class="body">
		<img src="../../../assets/vinciLogin.png" />
		<p>I began the full version of the product by implementing user functionality. I started with account creation and soon followed it with login functionality. The first version of these features utilized browser cookies to store user state and passwords were not encrypted whatsoever. Not long after implementing this functionality, I realized how much of a security issue this would be. This would allow users access to functionality that they should not have access to if they were to inject a cookie into their browser. I also added password encryption so that no one would be able to access the passwords without first reverse engineering the encryption.<br><br>After fixing some of the faulty user functionality, I dove into creating an initial version of a user profile. The basic profile displayed a user’s basic information. This was intended to be another security feature to allow user’s to know who they are talking to and see how much and often they interact with the application. We wanted to keep our users safe and help them feel secure while using our product.</p>

	<h2>Events</h2>
	<div class="body">
		<img src="../../../assets/vinciMap.png" />
		<p>Adding in Google Maps ended up being a more difficult process than I had initially thought it would be. I started by creating a feature for users to create events. In order to do this I had to then include the Google Places API to ensure that users were inputting correct locations in a way that could be decoded into its latitude and longitude coordinates on the backend. I struggled with this a little because I had little experience working with APIs and was not well acquainted to understanding documentation and getting API keys.<br><br>Once events were able to be created, I embarked on creating a view for them to be displayed. I had previously implemented the Google Maps API in the MVP that I had created, so that didn’t end up being any more difficult than before. I did struggle with event times though because I did not think through how to handle time zones. Even though the scope of the application would have been local initially, when I first uploaded a version to the server I realized that the time differences between the local time and server time would become a problem. I spent weeks debugging this issue and figuring out the proper way to handle times and I am certain that the way that is implemented currently in the code probably still contains bugs.<br><br>I did get to a point where the user could specify event privacy as well as invite people to the event by email. In the current implementation, there is still no way for the user to create a multiday event or to specify event recurrence. These are features that I never thought to include, but would have been great for a version two of the product if we had ever released.</p>

	<h2>Additional Functionality</h2>
	<div class="body">
		<img src="../../../assets/vinciCreateEvent.png" />
		<p>I spent a large amount of time focusing on auxiliary features. These features included a social media feed, a calendar that showed events, and a realtime private messaging system. These features were unnecessary for release, but I enjoyed creating and so I got ahead of myself. The social media feed created a significant time sink as I had to interface with Google Drive. The documentation for the Google Drive API at the time lacked information about how to connect. After a while I did figure out how to send and request data from the Google Drive servers. I then ran into issues with requesting batch data and ran into issues with information being missing when it was returned to the page. This likely could have been solved with promises, but I didn’t have a large enough background in web development to have learned the higher level concepts.<br><br>The other notable and time consuming feature that I implemented was the realtime private messaging. I ended up utilizing Socket.io which is built on top of WebSocket. Creating an application with one room for users to message each other didn’t take too long to create, but expanding it to multiple rooms with different users ended up being a pain. One of the harder parts of development proved to be testing as it required multiple accounts on multiple browsers and multiple computers. The current implementation seems to work, but could have fairly significant bugs as it hasn’t been tested exhaustively at any sizable scale.</p>

	<h2>Mobile</h2>
	<div class="body">
		<img src="../../../assets/vinciEventList.png" />
		<p>After creating a web version of our product we decided that it would be in our best interest to create a mobile version of the application. To do this as quick as possible, we tried to use Apache Cordova. Converting the application this way ended up causing more troubles because not everything well and there were issues with the user interface working slowly and data being passed through the app. This likely could have been due to the way that the web application was built, but I decided to scrap Cordova and pick up React Native. There was a learning curve in using React Native, but the quality tradeoff made the switch worth it.</p>

	<h2>Conclusions</h2>
	<div class="body">
		<img src="../../../assets/vinciProfile.png" />
		<p>I appreciate the opportunity to be able to learn new languages and technologies. I also didn’t spend nearly enough time thinking through the design of the application through before starting development. I also spent time designing the aesthetics of the application on the fly which also ended up slowing me down as I changed the designs every so often to be able to include new features and display new data. </p>
