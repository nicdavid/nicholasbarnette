	<h1>SRG Mobile Application</h1>
	<p>This project focuses on the process that I used to design my first mobile application. This project occurred iteratively over about a period of two weeks as it took me a while to figure out how to use Figma and do some research. All designs are by me and are property of Surin Restaurant Group (SRG).</p>

	<h2>Inspiration</h2>

		<p>I began this application at the request of the founder and CEO of Surin Restaurant Group (SRG). He wanted to build a mobile application to allow customers the ability to order from their phone. Every large brand now has a way to install an app on their phone and they are finding much success with giving customers this option. In order to keep up with the industry, SRG believes that this something unavoidable.<br><br>Being my first design project, I began by doing research about wireframing applications. I had taken a class as an undergraduate student that taught me how to use Adobe Illustrator. Since I no longer have access to the free student licence, I decided to give some of the free applications a try. After doing research and talking to some people, I chose to try out Figma.</p>

	<h2>Research</h2>

		<p>Since I have little experience with design and user experience I began the process by looking at apps that other restaurants offer. I found mixed results with this technique. Some of the apps were very visually unapealing while others were well designed, but didn’t quite match the aesthetic that SRG wants to acheive.<br><br>After looking at similar mobile apps, I began drawing out some wireframes on paper. When designing, I find that drawing is the easiest way for me to iterate to a point that I believe is worth wireframing in software. Once I reached a satisfactory design, I began creating some of the initial screens in Figma. As I needed content that was repeated throughout the design such as inputs, buttons, and lists, I turned some pieces into components.</p>

			<p>Once I had built out a couple frames, I started creating some basic icons. I had never worked with creating iconography, but I have worked with icons on webpages. This gave me some background in how to create them as I understood that they should all be roughly the same size and should have a consistent style. I began playing with the built in shape tools that Figma offers and built some mediocre looking icons. After scraping a couple versions, I finally started to get a hang of the tools. I still needed direction though, so I did some more research to see what icons portray the desired information. It is important to me that a user can use already learned information to be able to understand what information each icon attempts to portray. After a couple more hours of experimenting, I finally achieved some designs that look decent. I have added a couple examples above.</p>

	<h2>Iterative Design</h2>
	<div class="body">
		<img src="../../../assets/surinMenuSection.png" />
		<p>The first iterations of the designs relied heavily on static lists with little imagery. The next iterations featured a carousel design with tiles, but I quickly moved away from the carousel because it caused cluttering of the interface. The current design features images of each dish as well as the price. Tapping on the dish will add the dish to the order and tapping the information icon will show the user more information about the dish including a description, ditary restrictions as well as macronutrient information. In hindsight, I think it would be best to switch the functionality to have a quick add button on the tile and then bring up the detailed information when the user taps the tile.</p>

	<h2>Conclusions</h2>
	<div class="body">
		<img src="../../../assets/surinMenuItem.png" />
		<p>I enjoyed the experience of being able to design a mobile application from scratch. Compared to Adobe Illustrator, I found the design process in Figma to be much easier and user friendly. On top of that, I can use it in the browser and I can work on my designs whenever and wherever inspiration strikes me. At this point I haven’t received any feedback about the application from SRG because we are held up on whether or not we are able to integrate third party applications with the current ordering system.<br><br>There are still updates that I would like to make and pieces of the app that I am not totally happy with. For example, I think the bottom navigation sticks out from the look of the rest of the application. I think that it is partially due to the color palette that I am using as well as the icons not looking as sleek as I want them to. I think that the lighter grey used mostly in the background could use some sort of graient to increase visual appeal.<br><br>From a development perspective, I believe that building out this application would be easy since it makes use of many of the same components across the majority of the application.</p>
